This is a small webpage designed to parse through and search the 2014 Boston Employee Earnings Report and it will output an average salary for that position based on 'Total Earnings'. The application's search functionality does include partials so I have added an output of all the job titles if you'd like to search for a specific job 'Title'.

Simply type in your search query, such as 'Teacher' or 'Fire Fighter' and the page will output your search results.
