# BeerCodingChallenge

This is a small webpage designed to parse through and search the 2014 Boston Employee Earnings Report and it will output an average salary for that position based on 'Total Earnings'. The application's search functionality does include partials so I have added an output of all the job titles if you'd like to search for a specific job 'Title'.

Simply type in your search query, such as 'Teacher' or 'Fire Fighter' and the page will output your search results.

The reason I used Javascript was because it seemed like the best tool for this job. It would be quick and simple and for me to make this application in a Ruby on Rails environment I would end up using the exact Javascript tools(AJAX, JQuery) that I used in this much simpler application.

If I were to have some more time on this I would definitely improve the UI and probably build on this application using another Javascript framework like REACT and I would tweak the search bar so it is smoother when loading data.

Please checkout some of other pieces of work I am particularly proud of
